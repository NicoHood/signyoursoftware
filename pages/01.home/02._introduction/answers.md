### What is signed Software?

Digital signatures can be used to digitally sign software using public-key cryptography. A valid digital signature can be used to confirm the authenticity of the issuer and thus the integrity of the software. The most common software used to create digital signatures is GPG.

### Why sign your Software?

Digitally signed software prevents attackers from manipulating your software on the way between you and the user. For example, by hacking the web space or manipulating the transport (download) of your software.

### Who needs signed Software?

Digital signatures are not only important for security-conscious users, but especially for software packagers. The packaged software is distributed to a large number of users, therefore the security of the software is especially important.
